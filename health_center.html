                                <p>When evaluating healthcare accessibility, various factors must be considered. 
                                    One key aspect is the distance to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) 
                                    in Connecticut and how this impacts accessibility for certain populations. 
                                    The data used comes from U.S. census tract population information and the Centers 
                                    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Analyzing the distribution of FQHCs 
                                    and their distance from different communities is crucial to understanding whether 
                                    these centers are easily accessible. Additionally, understanding where FQHCs are 
                                    located in relation to the target population helps guide effective resource 
                                    allocation.</p>
                                    <p> <h4 class="h3 mb-3">Goal: </h4> </p>
                                    <p>The goal is to calculate geographic access to FQHCs and estimate how the population 
                                        below the poverty level in Connecticut is served by these centers within a 1-mile 
                                        proximity, using US Census Tract population data.</p>
                                <h4 class="h3 mb-3">What I did:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Proximity-Based Analysis: The exercise involves comparing two types of proximity-based 
                                        analyses: a 1-mile Euclidean distance (straight line) buffer and a 1-mile Network-based 
                                        service area for Federally Qualified Health Care Centers (FQHCs) in Connecticut.</li>
                                    <li>Tools and Techniques: Arc GIS Pro tools and Esri Extensions, specifically the buffer tool, are used to create 
                                        both Euclidean and Network-based distance areas. Population data is aggregated using population-weighted 
                                        centroids to generate service areas.</li>
                                    <li>Target Population Estimation: Census tract population centers falling within the 1-mile buffer or 
                                        network service area are selected, and the populations within these areas are summed to estimate 
                                        how many people have geographic access to a FQHC.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    population with access to an FQHC within a 1-mile radius, for both Euclidean and network analyses.</p>

                                                high concentrations of single-female households in Connecticut. Most FQHCs 
                                                are situated in or near densely populated areas where single-female households 
                                                are more prevalent.</p>

                                            many of the centers are spread across regions with medium to smaller populations of 
                                            individuals living below the poverty line, according to census tract data.</p>

                                                Figure 3, which displays 1-mile Euclidean buffers around the FQHCs, may give the impression 
                                                that the centers are well distributed across the population and land area. However, 
                                                Table 1 reveals that FQHCs are not as closely located to areas with higher concentrations of 
                                                the foreign-born population.</p>

                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </section>
                              <p> <h4 class="h3 mb-3">Summary:</h4> </p>
                              <p>The analysis reveals that while visual representations, such as in Figure 1, suggest that FQHCs are well-distributed 
                                among high populations of single-female households, the data in Table 1 tells a different story. The Euclidean distance 
                                shows 43.3% of single-female households have access to FQHCs, while the networked distance is lower at 33.8%. A similar 
                                pattern emerges in Figure 2, which appears to show good coverage for populations below the poverty line, but Table 1 shows 
                                networked access at only 44.8%, with Euclidean distance slightly better at 53.9%. </p>
                               <p>
                                This highlights the importance of conducting both Euclidean and network analysis rather than relying solely on visual maps. 
                                While Euclidean distance measures straight-line proximity, network analysis considers real-world barriers like road networks, 
                                giving a more accurate picture of accessibility. The results show that, despite the visual maps suggesting widespread access, 
                                structural barriers reduce actual access to FQHCs, especially for marginalized groups like foreign-born populations. For example, 
                                only 42.1% of the foreign population has access to FQHCs via Euclidean distance, and just 32% through the network analysis. This 
                                demonstrates the need for more comprehensive methods when allocating resources to vulnerable populations.
